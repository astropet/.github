## 🚀 × About Us
We are a group of people building the next era of pet essentials.

## ⌨️ × Contributing
== Ease of Contributions ==\n
Our software is written in modern programming languages that you don't have to be 50 years old to know. We don't use Ruby & Go, we use Javascript & Python. This means if you want something changed, you can easily change it yourself.
To clear something up, It's not like we don't like Ruby & Go, we just don't think it's the right tool for the job.

== API Documention ==\n
We document the API for everything, so you don't have to worry what does what. The documentation is currently under construction, but it should be realeased soon after everything is released.

== Pull Requests ==\n
Be nice in PRs and PR comments, don't yell at people for something "stupid" they may have done. Make sure to allow everyone to speak their mind, don't call a feature stupid just becuase you don't like it; everyone likes (or wants) different things.

## 🔒 × Maintainers
