# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 × About Us

## ⌨️ × Contributing
Be nice in PRs and PR comments, don't yell at people for something "stupid" they may have done. Make sure to allow everyone to speak their mind, don't call a feature stupid just becuase you don't like it; everyone likes (or wants) different things.

## 🔒 × Maintainers
Theese people maintain the various projects & review pull reuqests. Message them on Discord or email if you need help or want to ask a question. Don't annoy them, they are very buisy people with more importaint things to deal with.
